## My Personal Project: A Creative Coding Playground

This is a personal project where I'm exploring web development, design, and my own creativity. It's a work in progress, and I'll be adding features and improvements over time.

### Goals

* **Aesthetically Pleasing Design:**  I aim to create a visually engaging experience with smooth animations and a clean, modern look.
* **Coding Skills Development:** This project is a space for me to learn and practice coding in my free time.
* **Personalized Profile Page:**  I want to create a central hub for my favorite links, apps, and projects, making it easier for me to access them.

## Features & Ideas

### Visual Enhancements

* **Dynamic Background:** I'm experimenting with subtle animations or changing gradients to create a dynamic visual experience that might reflect my mood or the time of day.
* **Interactive Links:** I want to go beyond simple color changes for links. Think subtle glows, gentle movements, or icons that appear on hover.
* **Custom Cursor:**  A thematic cursor design can enhance the overall aesthetic.
* **Audio Visualizer:**  A minimal, responsive visualizer that displays my Spotify playlist or current song.

### Content & Information

* **Quote Rotator:**  Rotating quotes about coding, technology, or life, reflecting my personal interests.
* **Recent Projects Showcase:**  Showcasing my latest projects with brief descriptions and links to their repositories. 
* **Skills & Tech Stack:**  A visually appealing section highlighting my programming languages, frameworks, and tools, potentially with interactive tooltips for more details. 
* **Code Snippet:**  Featuring a cool code snippet that I'm proud of, highlighted for visual appeal.
* **Coding Achievements:**  Displaying my accomplishments from platforms like GitHub (contributions, stars), MonkeyType (typing speed), etc.

### Interactive & Functional Features

* **Light/Dark Mode:**  Providing users with the option to choose their preferred theme.
* **Personalized Greeting:**  Using JavaScript to display a greeting based on the time of day (e.g., "Good morning").
* **Mini-Game:**  Adding a small, interactive game, like a text-based adventure or puzzle, to keep things engaging.
* **Web Page Expansion:** I plan to add more web pages, improve the Spotify playlist page, and create a more comprehensive bookmarks section with folders for organization.

I'm excited to see this project evolve and learn as I go. I'll be sharing updates and progress along the way on my telegram channel (found on Main Page)!
