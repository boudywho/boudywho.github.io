# This is a personal project, like it or not, dumb or not, I will be updating it once in a while

### Goal
- Trying to make it aesthetically pleasing with nice animations
- Learn Basic Coding in my free time
- Basic Profile Page that contains all my mostly used links and apps

## Things I wanna add
**Visual Enhancements:**

* **Dynamic Background:** Instead of a static image, maybe a subtle animation or a slowly changing gradient. This could reflect my current mood or time of day.
* **Interactive Elements:** Add hover effects to my links beyond just color change. Maybe a subtle glow, a slight movement, or an icon that appears.
* **Custom Cursor:**  A simple, thematic change to my cursor can make it more pleasing.
* **Visualizer:**  A small, minimally designed audio visualizer that responds to my embedded Spotify playlist (or song).

**Content Ideas:**

* **Quote Rotator:**  Display a rotating selection of my favorite quotes about coding, technology, or life in general.
* **Recent Projects:** Showcase a few of my latest projects with brief descriptions and links to their repositories. 
* **Skills/Tech Stack:**  Create a visually appealing section that lists my programming languages, frameworks, and tools. maybe make this interactive with tooltips for more info. 
* **Code Snippet:**  Feature a cool code snippet I'm proud of, maybe with a syntax highlighter for visual appeal.
* **Achievements/Stats:** Showcase coding achievements from platforms like GitHub (contributions, stars), MonkeyType (typing speed), etc. 

**Interactive/Functional:**

* **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:**  Give users the option to switch between themes.
* **Personalized Greeting:**  Use JavaScript to display a greeting based on the time of day (e.g., "Good morning").
* **Mini-Game:** A simple interactive game, like a text-based adventure or a small puzzle, could be a fun addition. Keep it minimal and in line with my overall design.
* **More webpages**
* **Better Playlist (Spotify) page**
* **More Bookmarks**
* **Folders in the bookmarks page**
